This directory contains example server configurations for ndg_oauth.  Each
configuration contains a simple script to run the server using paster and an
ini file which sets the combination of middleware and config settings needed.

ceda/ -             standard oauth usage

slcs/ -             short-lived credential service returns an X.509 cert as 
                    token.  It uses MyProxy as a backend service to issue certs.  
                    A test MyProxyCA service is needed for this configured with 
                    a custom PAM to allow of a global password. See:
